  <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.</p>
  <p>AI powers technologies like chatbots, self-driving cars, facial recognition, and smart assistants. It is rapidly transforming how we work and interact with technology.</p>
  <p>Governments and businesses across the world are investing heavily in AI due to its ability to automate complex tasks, analyze massive data, and make predictions.</p>
  <p>As AI evolves, discussions around ethics, transparency, and human oversight are becoming more important than ever before.</p>

  <div id="countdown">Redirecting in 6 seconds...</div>

  <script>
    let seconds = 6;
    const countdownEl = document.getElementById("countdown");
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      seconds--;
      if (seconds > 0) {
        countdownEl.textContent = "Redirecting in " + seconds + " seconds...";
      } else {
        countdownEl.textContent = "Redirecting now...";
        clearInterval(interval);
      }
    }, 1000);
